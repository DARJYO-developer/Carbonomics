clean tech revolution


-- achieve net zero carbon

three key interconnected scalable technologies:
1) Electrification through renewable power dominates the lower part of the cost curve and has potential to de-carbonize around half of CO2 emissions, with power generation tripling by 2060 – dominated by wind and solar, driving increased demand for base metals such as copper (+15%) and a complete overhaul of the country’s power networks; 
2) Clean Hydrogen is the second most important technology, potentially driving 20% of the de-carbonization, mostly in industry and heating; 
3) Carbon Capture could address 15% of emissions, mostly in industrial processes. Exports contribute c.20% of CO2 emissions (gross): growing global consumer awareness of the carbon footprint of goods and the prospect of a border adjustment on carbon prices add urgency to net zero policy and highlight the importance of carbon markets.
